# Custom SOD Generator
## This repository includes:
- A bash script to play Ascii Video Frames in a series of systemd-bsod - bluescreens on linux. (Thanks [@FlyTechVideos](https://github.com/FlyTechVideos) for big parts of the bash code!!)
- A python script to convert videos to a format readable by the player.
- Tested with Python version 3.10 and 3.11.

## How to use
### Generate custom frame file
- There's a pregenerated file for "Bad Apple" generated by [@FlyTechVideos](https://github.com/FlyTechVideos) using https://github.com/Chion82/ASCII_bad_apple.
- To generate your own frame file, create a new venv `python -m venv name_of_venv` enter it by typing `source name_of_venv/bin/activate`.
- Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies inside the venv.
- Type `python genFrames.py video.mp4 frames.txt -n 3`. The first file is the input video, the second file is the output file and the `-n` flag describes how many of the frames get converted.
- Higher `-n` -> faster playback with less frames. `-n 1` is every frame, `-n 2` is every second, ect.
- Deactivate the venv by typing `deactivate`.
- Continue with "Play back frame file".

### Play back frame file
- Type `sudo bash start.sh` for the default frames.txt or type `sudo bash start.sh framefile7.txt` for using a frame file called "framefile7.txt".
